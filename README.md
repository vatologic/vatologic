# Oooooi!

I'm Bj√∂rn and for lack of a more suitable explanation, you've reached my digital habedashery of sorts.

###### :electron: &nbsp; SOFTWARE ENGINEERING / SCRIPTING
I used to dream in PHP, but lately I'm leaning towards JS. ElectronJS, Svelte and Node to be precise. Python has creeped into my system as well. Also able to rummage something up in Ruby, Bash, Max and ExtendScript as well. I speak about every common dialect of SQL. Yet, since our foreign keys have not been in touch lately I fear I might dive into MongoDB soon. Me and Wordpress have had a very long relation, but she's gotten a bit bloated and sluggish.

###### :desktop_computer: &nbsp; GRAPHIC DESIGN
Anything Adobe I can pretty much dream. SketchUp is my dirty little secret and Blender my latest crush. I'm not too shabby with a DSLR, but don't ask me to film - I love caffeine too much to have a steady hand.

###### :loud_sound: &nbsp; MUSIC PRODUCTION
Ableton Live is my main DAW, although I can work in Logic, FLStudio, Cubase and Reason as well. I have a bit of habit of creating my own Max for Live plugins. Whatever music theory I lack, I make up in the proverbial nerd department. Had a couple of UK chart hits and travelled the globe for about a decade and a half. Did Tomorrowland a few times, but still love dodgy basements full of geeks and freaks. 

##### Contact
If it's about anything Github related - jot me a message here. I'm not here on a daily basis, but I do check my messages every now and then. For more pressing and urgent things  send me a message ~~in a bottle~~ on https://instagram.com/vatogonzalez
